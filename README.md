# IPL-simulator
This program allows you to simulate the Indian Premier League. You enter what happens in each ball and the program will run as per instructions.

## You have to install the pandas module in order to run. To do so, please run this on the command prompt: pip install pandas
This program is still not perfect because though it can load the data from the csv file, it is still unable to load the data back to it. Moreover, it is only able to play the first innings up till now. I will be regularly updating the code in order to look into these problems and will fix as soon as possible üòÅ
